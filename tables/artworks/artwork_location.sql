--* The artwork_location table keeps track of the locations of either an artwork or an editioned artwork, along with the organizations or individuals responsible for them. It includes metadata fields, location types (e.g., 'on loan', 'in storage'), time-stamps for when the artwork was moved in and out, and constraints to ensure that each record is associated with either an artwork or an edition, and either an organization or a person.
