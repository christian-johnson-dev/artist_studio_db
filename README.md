# Artist Studio Database

The Artist Studio Database is designed for an artist's studio and records their artwork and how each piece relates to the world outside the studio-- exhibitions, publications, collectors, etc. It is written in PostgreSQL. A data-dictionary is included in the repository under [`Wiki`](https://github.com/vngogh1/artist_studio_db/wiki).
